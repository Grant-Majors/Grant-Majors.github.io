A nearby children’s science museum wanted a robotic arm exhibit for the kids to interact with. This exhibit had to conform to set size, durability, and repairability constraints.</p>

To overcome this issue, I added integrated gears to each arm segment on the right side that interact with the servo motor embedded in the previous segment.</p>

              This project required one teammate and I to design and test a load cell with a rated capacity of 250lbs. The design was initially created and tested in SolidWorks then CNC machined out of aluminum stock with strain gauges applied in areas of high strain. After testing was done, we were able to characterize the load cell for resolution, total error, hysteresis, and more.

              The most challenging part of this project was figuring out how to apply known loads for testing. Just before we started this project, the engineering departments tensile machine broke. Once we learned of this, we were given two options: figure out how to test with 250lbs or design a lower capacity load cell. As seen in the above photo, My teammate and I borrowed calibrated weight plates and a barbell from the campus gym and hung them from a table for testing.

              This project was successful in meeting all of the required criteria. Even without access to the tensile machine, we were able to apply the maximum rated load in 50lb increments and get accurate and acceptable data for characterization.

            <p class="description_text">This Graffiti Robot was part of one of the project-based classes during my junior year. We were tasked with designing a robot that was able to reproduce images onto the ground using any medium. The robot was required to have a working area of at least 2.5ft^2, mark concrete and wood, and be able to be carried by one person.</p>

            <p class="description_text">My primary role during this project was programming the robot while also assisting with its design. The most challenging part of this project was our budget of $150; after buying the necessary electronic components and belts, we were left with $30 to build the frame of the robot. As a team, we decided that pvc pipe would be a suitable choice for the frame as well as the “linear rails”.</p>

            <p class="description_text">While all the other teams used markers or pens for their robots, we were the only team to use actual paint. We were also the only team to not use a ‘typical’ x-y gantry design. Our robot was confined to 2.5ft width images, however, the length of the image could theoretically be infinite, or curved due to the entire frame being mobile with individually driven wheels on either side.</p>

              This project required a team of two others and myself to model and verify a SolidWorks simulation of a welded component. My team decided to test a link from one team members Toyota 4 runner, loaded in compression to induce buckling.

              This project was done at the same time as the load cell project above. As such, the tensile machine was broken, meaning we could not load the link in tension as originally planned. To help remedy this, our professor brought in a pneumatic press to facilitate the testing. With this press we had to create the fixturing that would allow the link to stay in column until it buckled.

              This project successfully verified the results of the simplified SolidWorks simulation with an error of 2%. This error may have been able to be reduced further if we knew what type of steel the link was made of. To get an accurate estimate of its properties, the link's hardness was tested and then converted to an elastic modulus to be used in the simulation.

The rover had to be able to navigate rough terrain while maintaining movement accuracy and indicate when it had completed its task. As the semester progressed, we were required to adapt our rover to be able to complete ‘missions’ with increasing difficulty. The first mission was to drive in a 10ft square and end up within 3ft of its starting location and the final mission was to navigate to a specified set of coordinates.</p>
