              The inspiration for this project came from a video I saw where
              someone had a custom circuit board made to mount 5 displays and
              have them display different things. I decided that I wanted
              something like that to display stock prices in real time.

              This is my first project using an ESP32 and an API to grab data
              from, as such, the greatest challenge in this project was learning
              how to use both of those things. I started by watching lots of
              YouTube videos on ESP32's and how to connect them to the internet
              and an API. Then when I had other problems, I would search forums
              and google to get it working.

              The finished product seen above features 5 GC9A01 displays powered
              by an ESP32 in a 3D printed enclosure designed by me. When the
              tracker gets plugged in, it automatically connects to the internet
              and starts displaying current stock data. In the future I plan to
              add more 'widgets' such as time, and weather.

              The inspiration for this project came from yet another video that
              I saw of a guy who built his own custom desk out of steel square
              tubing and hardwood he was given. I love a big desk, however, most
              of the store-bought ones are expensive and lackluster with
              features. So why not build one myself!?

              Overall, this design was not hard to make and came with minimal
              challenges. However, I did design this in Autodesk Fusion rather
              than SolidWorks. I have been using SolidWorks for the past 4 years
              during school, but decided to switch it up to experiment with a
              different CAD program.

              This project is a work in progress at the time of writing. The
              desk is fully designed but I need to find a welder that I can use
              to produce the different welded pieces that are then assembled to
              complete the desk.
